tapview is a minimalist pure consumer for TAP (Test Anything Protocol).

It's intended for projects that aleady have one or more TAP producers
built into their code and want a viewer that is small, lightweight,
portable, has no pesky dependencies, and can easily be embedded in
a project distribution.

tapview has a line-by-line parser, so it adds as little latency
to your test-viewing pipeline as possible.

tapview requires only a POSIX-compliant shell and an echo comand
that honors the -n switch (which POSIX allows but does not require).

Permission is specifically granted for this code to be redistributed
under the prevailing license of your project, provided that license
is OSD-compliant. Otherwise 2-clause BSD applies.
